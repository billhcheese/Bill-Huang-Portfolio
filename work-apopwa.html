                  <p>The intention of this toolset is to help all parties interested in stewarding public-owned properties well. The toolset enables users to have more informed decisions of what public properties would be best preserved, developed, or renovated for the good of Atlanta. These tools were developed to gather data and analyze the publicly-owned land inside the City of Atlanta. As the toolset was originally intended for the use of the Office of Housing and Community Development, the tool tends to display data and enable analysis that is oriented toward said officeâ€™s work. However, with the interest of transparency and enabling public residents, this toolset has been redirected for public use as well.</p>

            <h5>Project Walkthrough</h5>
            <p>I built this tool up starting from an excel sheet of parcels. My supervisor was awesome in
              giving me guidance and feedback through this project though!
              I used ArcGIS Pro to perform attribute and spatial joins to create the base layers for this
              map. My knowledge of property development assisted me in selecting relevant variables to analysis
              the properties through. I then had to find the data for these variables.
              This part took a long time, I had to go snooping around the organization, partner orgs, and the internet
              for additional data sources that were not immediately avaliable to me. I used internal data sources
              for the city parks, federal online sources for the raster slope topoology, and reached out to
              Atlanta Housing Authority for various tax data. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The meat of my work then came when deciding the methodology to determine which properties were fit
              for certain development types. I researched MCDA and debated using multiple methods like AHP and
              TOPSIS. However, I decided to go with the simplest which is closest to a weighted summation 
              because City of Atlanta(CoA) staff was not able to support that level of ongoing detailed analysis
              at that time. All of the data source variables were fed into ArcGIS Pro and Python was used to
              automate the algorithm in ArcGIS to score and rank each parcel based upon its suitability for
              certain types of development(multi-use residential, park, affordable housing, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              While I had generated these results, there was no easy way to explore and view them. From there,
              I created an outward facing ArcGIS Webapp which includes the funcationalities mentioned above
              and more! An example of the filtering capability is shown to the left where a user can specify
              the size of property they want to look at. You can see the result before and after below amongst
              other example funcationalities of the tool!
