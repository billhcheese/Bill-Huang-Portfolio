                  <h5 class="h5">Project Motivation</h5>
                  <p>Ethnic restaurants appear in many areas of the Atlanta Metro Area. These ethnic restaurants
                    play a part in Atlanta being nationally recognized as a city with great food options. Atlanta also,
                    coincidentally (or not), has a sizable immigrant population from many countries. Often, immigrants in
                    America make a living and share their birth nation culture through starting restaurants that serve the
                    foods of their origin nation. Additionally, immigrant populations in America may tend to frequent and
                    generate demand for food from their origin nation in their new locale. A theory that this project explores
                    is that there is a relationship between the physical prescence of immigrant populations and ethnic
                    restaurants in Atlanta. In the future, it would be interesting to think about how investing in immigrants
                    could stimulate ethnic restaurant economic and cultural activity in a region. This project looks to answer
                    three questions. 1. Where are ethnic restaurants located in Atlanta? 2. Where are immigrant populations
                    residing in Atlanta? 3. Is a statistically significant relationship between the population of ethnic
                    restaurants and immigrant population residences in Atlanta? The datasets are shown below</p>

            <h5>Project Walkthrough</h5>
            <p>A multitude of analysis techniques were used to answer the project questions. The first question
              is “Where are ethnic restaurants located in the Atlanta area?” It would be helpful to know which areas of
              Atlanta have large clusters of ethnics restaurants to answer this question. Therefore, a hotspot analysis
              using Getis-Ord Gi* is conducted on the ethnic restaurant population by census tract. Inverse distance
              squared in Euclidean space was chosen for the conceptualization of spatial relationships as a mix
              between local and regional analysis is desired for the three included countries of the dataset. To answer the second question “Where are immigrant populations residing in the Atlanta area?”,
              the same analysis method of a hotspot analysis using Getis-Ord Gi* was used except with the ForeignBorn Population dataset from the ACS 2021 5-Year on census tracts. Additionally, to answer these two
              questions, it would be revealing to see where the mean center of the ethnic restaurants are compared to
              the mean center of Foreign-Born residents. Both the mean center of the ethnic restaurant points and the
              mean center of census tracts weighted by Foreign-Born residents were calculated along with their first
              standard deviation distribution ellipses.

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              While the hotspot analysis sheds some light on the clustering of immigrants and ethnic
              restaurants, exploring the spatial autocorrelation of immigrants and ethnic restaurants also reveals if
              immigrant residences tend to cluster with themselves. A spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran’s I
              was performed for immigrant populations and ethnic restaurant populations.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              To answer the third question “Is a statistically significant relationship between the population of ethnic restaurants and immigrant population residences in the Atlanta Area?”, an OLS regression analysis is performed. A general OLS regression is performed on census tract geometries with the dependent variable being the population of ethnic restaurants and the explanatory variable being the population of Foreign-Born residents. Having more statistically significant explanatory variables beyond just foreign-born residents would make the regression model more trustworthy for analysis. Since this project is not concerned with the other possible explanatory variables, they are omitted from the model. A more in-depth regression using different ethnic groups of foreign-born residents as explanatory variables is also performed to see if any particular ethnic group has larger influence on the population of ethnic restaurants. The included ethnic groups were European, Asian, African, Oceania, Americas(excluding the US).

            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              This project set out to answer questions on the locations and distribution of ethnic restaurants in the Atlanta area, the locations and distributions of foreign-born populations in the Atlanta area, and the existence of a statistically significant relationship between foreign-born populations and ethnic restaurant populations within census tracts of the Atlanta area. Using spatial autocorrelation, hotspot, and regression methods, the questions have been answered. Generally, the foreign-born populations reside in the northeast of Atlanta. The ethnic restaurants also follow that same locational trend except with a larger presence in the center of Atlanta as well. There does exist a statistically significant relationship between foreign-born populations and ethnic restaurant populations in the Atlanta area, but foreign-born populations are poor predictors of the number of ethnic restaurants in tract resolution locales in the Atlanta area. These findings using socioeconomic GIS methods are confirmed by experiential and qualitative finding of the prescence of foreign-born populations and ethnic restaurants in the Atlanta area as well. The findings are useful to understand the restaurant and diversity spatial layout of the Atlanta area. Such analysis could be applied to other city regions to gain an understanding of the restaurant and diversity layouts. Additionally, the report finding put more credence towards a theory that immigrants do generate more ethnic restaurants for a region. Such restaurant generation can help not only share diverse food cultures to a city, but also generate economic activity and cultural hotspots. The hotspot analysis does show that, in the Atlanta area, that clusters of these restaurants and immigrant populations do exist. When these hotspots are combined with agglomerative theories, such analysis could also inform planning parameters around immigrant residence populations and restaurants for locales in cities.
