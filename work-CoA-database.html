            <h2>City of Atlanta Office of Housing and Community Development Data Management</h2>
            <p>TLDR: The City of Atlanta did not have a good solution for storing and allowing edits to their housing program records. Using ArcGIS Online, I proposed a better method for storage and revision.</p>

                  <h5 class="h5">Project Motivation</h5>
                  <p>The Office of Housing and Community Development within the City of Atlanta Department of City Planning was having difficultly tracking housing program data and development progress. The starting state of the data storage was essentially many different versions of online spreadsheets and GIS layers. They were started to have issues not being able to let many people make edits in a short period of time, errors inputting data, versions falling out of sync, and not being able to share the information in a timely manner with stakeholders in an appropriate format. I hopped into this project, because it really bothered me that these issues kept happening and there was not a solution on the horizon. Below shows an example of the various different platforms and information transfers that had to be made between ESRI platforms and Microsoft, Airtable, and Softr platforms in the existing way they operated. The ideal solution for this would be to implement a legitimate database system, but the office did not have the resources nor the staff expertise to properly run, maintain, and access such technologies. So, I proposed a quasi-database system of sorts on AGOL where our data storage units would be AGOL Layers.</p>

            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <h6>The proposed system I designed for a next step to impliment keeping in mind the technology limitations of the office staff was as follows.</h6>
            <img src="assets/img/database-ideal.png"
                  width="1000">
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <h6>This was designed three big points in mind. 1. Redudant Data should be eliminated. Redudant data causes many issues such as slowing down sync times, increasing storage cost, increasing data accuracy errors, and increasing time spend manually updating any data. 2. Large data sizes due to redudant data means slower data processing for any data search or operation. 3. When batch updating, there are longer down times and higher risks of compromising the datasets. So this new data storage and flow system create more production and editing layers essentially while reducing the number of platforms store the same information on. The new edits include 1.Everything gets moved to ESRI platforms 2. Separate data layers exist for record storage and production output products. 3. Separate property development data from public property databases as there is not a innate relationship between the two.</h6>
