                  <p>The project was born from a desire to investigate non-traditional structures in how cities operate, in this case the flow of people. Traditionally, top-down categories were defined in travel surveys for types of commutes such as stay-at-home spouse, student, or long distance commuter. These are categories from historical observations and opinions, but what if there was a way to think about people flows from an objective point of view. With access to high-resolution data, this is now possible and was explored throughout this project. The setting for this project application was the Nihonbashi district in Tokyo as Mitsui Fudo-san and University of Tokyo supplied the data through a partnership with Georgia Tech for this Smart City Research</p>

            <h5>Project Walkthrough</h5>
            <p>This project was born through a capstone course Smart City research partnership between Georgia Tech and the University of Tokyo Kashiwanoha Campus CSIS Department in conjunction with Mitsui Fudosan(One of Japan's "Big 3" real estate developers along with Misubishi and Sumitomo).

            <p>
              The data sources we had to work with included GPS data from cell devices, the government's property parcel map, a Japanese Travel Survey for the Tokyo Area, and Japanese Census ChoChoMoku Data(CCM).

            <h6>Cleaning the data included using R sf package and python geopandas to connect individual data points into trips, combining data from different sources, and geospatial processing to summarize useful geospatial features for each trip. We ended up generating many features to cluster upon, but a few are shown here. </h6>
